<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> newspapers these days are becoming
more and more painful. I was reading
my morning papers on the train not so long
ago, and looked up with a feeling of desperation.
Up and down the car people were reading,
yet no one seemed excited.</p>

<p>To me the whole situation seems intolerable.
We face today a world filled with suspicion
and hatred. We look at Europe and
see a civil war going on, with other nations
participating not only as individual volunteers,
but obviously with the help and approval
of their governments. We look at the
Far East and see two nations, technically not
at war, killing each other in great numbers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span></p>

<p>Every nation is watching the others on its
borders, analyzing its own needs and striving
to attain its ends with little consideration for
the needs of its neighbors. Few people are
sitting down dispassionately to go over the
whole situation in an attempt to determine
what present conditions are, or how they
should be met.</p>

<p>We know, for instance, that certain nations
today need to expand because their populations
have increased. Certain people will tell
you that the solution of this whole question
lies in the acceptance or rejection of birth
control. That may be the solution for the
future, but we can do nothing in that way
about the populations that now exist. They
are on this earth, and modern science has left
us only a few places where famine or flood or
disease can wipe out large numbers of superfluous
people in one fell swoop. For this reason
certain nations need additional territory
to which part of their present populations
may be moved; other nations need more land
on which to grow necessary raw materials; or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>
perhaps they may need mineral deposits
which are not to be found in their own country.
You will say that these can be had by
trade. Yes, but the nations possessing them
will frequently make the cost too high to the
nations which need them.</p>

<p>It is not a question today of the “free”
interchange of goods. If standards of living
were approximately the same, throughout
the world, competition would be on an equal
basis and then there might be no need for
tariffs. However, standards of living vary.
The nations with higher standards have set
up protective barriers which served them
well when they were self-contained, but not
so well when they reached a point where they
either wished to import or export.</p>

<p>When you take all these things into consideration,
the size of this problem is apt to
make you feel that even an attempt to solve
it in the future by education is futile. Faint
heart, however, ne’er won fair lady, nor did
it ever solve world problems!</p>

<p>Peace plan after peace plan has been presented<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
to me; most of them, I find, are impractical,
or not very carefully thought out.
In nearly all of them some one can find a
flaw. I have come to look at them now without
the slightest hope of finding one full-fledged
plan, but I keep on looking in the
hope of finding here and there some small
suggestion that may be acceptable to enough
people to insure an honest effort being made
to study it and evaluate its possible benefits.</p>

<p>For instance, one lady of my acquaintance
brought me a plan this past spring
which sounded extremely plausible. Her
premises are: We never again wish to send
our men overseas; we wish to have adequate
defense; we do not need a navy if we do not
intend to go beyond our own shores; submarines
and airplanes can defend our shores,
with guns along our coasts as an added protection.
Therefore, we do not need an army,
for our men are going to stay at home. With
our coast defenses strong, nobody will land
here, so why go to the expense of an army?
We do not need battleships or, in fact, any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
navy beyond submarines because we do not
intend to own any outlying possessions.</p>

<p>In this way, said the lady, we will save vast
sums of money which can be applied to all
the social needs of the day—better housing,
better schools, old age pensions, workmen’s
compensation, care of the blind and crippled
and other dependents. There is no limit to
what we might do with this money which we
now spend on preparation for destruction.</p>

<p>It is a very attractive picture and I wish it
were all as simple as that, but it seems to be
fairly well proved that guns along our coasts
are practically useless. No one, as far as I
know, has ever devised an adequate defense
by submarines and airplanes, or calculated
whether the cost of the development of these
two forces would really be any less than what
we spend at present on our army and navy.</p>

<p>The greatest defense value of the navy is
that its cruising radius is great enough to
allow it to contact an attacking force long
before that force reaches our shores. If we
trusted solely to submarines and airplanes we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
would have to have them in sufficient number
really to cover all our borders, and this
type of defense would seem to be almost prohibitive
in cost for a nation with a great
many miles of border to defend.</p>

<p>Has any one sounded out the people of
this country as to their willingness to wait
until an attacking enemy comes within the
cruising radius of our planes and submarines?
Have we faced the fact that this would
mean allowing an attacking enemy to come
unmolested fairly near to our shores and
would make it entirely possible for them to
land in a nearby country which might be
friendly to them, without any interference
on our part? Have our citizens been asked if
they are willing to take the risk of doing
without trained men? We have always had a
small trained army forming the first line of
defense in case somebody does land on our
borders, or attempts to approach us by land
through a neighboring country. Our army
has not been thought of as an attacking
force; do we want to do away with it?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span></p>

<p>Are all the people in this country willing
also to give up the outlying islands which
have come into our possession? Some of them
cost us more than they bring in, but others
bring certain of our citizens a fair revenue.
Can we count on those citizens to accept the
loss of these revenues in the interests of
future peace?</p>

<p>Perhaps this is part of what we will have
to make up our minds to pay some day as
the price of peace; but has any one as yet put
it in concrete form to the American people
and asked their opinion about it?</p>

<p>One of the things that is most frequently
harped upon is the vast sums of money spent
for war preparation in this country. Very frequently
the statements are somewhat misleading.
It is true that in the past few years
we have spent more than we have for a number
of preceding years because we had fallen
behind in our treaty strength but, in a world
which is arming all around us, it is necessary
to keep a certain parity and these expenditures<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
should be analyzed with a little more
care than is usual.</p>

<p>For instance, few people realize that in
the army appropriation is included all the
work done under the army engineers on
rivers and harbors, on flood control, etc. One
other consideration which is frequently overlooked
is that, because of the higher wages
paid for labor in this country, whatever we
build costs us more than it does in the other
nations. One significant fact is that we only
spend twelve percent of our national income
on our army and navy, as against anywhere
from thirty-five to fifty-five percent of the national
income spent by nations in the rest of
the world. It is well for us to realize these
facts and not to feel that our government is
doing something that will push us into a
position which is incompatible with a desire
for peace. We are the most peace loving nation
in the world and we are not doing anything
at present which would change that
situation.</p>

<p>One very intelligent friend of mine developed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
an idea the other day which seems
to me common sense for the present time, at
least. “Why do we talk,” she asked, “about
peace? Why don’t we recognize the fact
that it is normal and natural for differences
to exist? Almost every family, no matter how
close its members may be, is quarrelsome at
times.” Quarrelsome may be too strong a
word, so we might better say that differences
of opinion arise in the family as to conduct
or as to likes and dislikes. Why should we
expect therefore, that nations will not have
these same differences and quarrels? Why do
we concentrate on urging them not to have
any differences? Why don’t we simply accept
the fact that differences always come up and
concentrate on evolving some kind of machinery
by which the differences may be recognized
and some plan of compromise be
worked out to satisfy, at least in part, all
those concerned? Compromises, of course,
have to be made; they are made in every family.
There are usually some members of a
family, who, by common consent, are the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
arbitrators of questions that arise, and who
hold the family together, or bring them together
if relationships become strained.</p>

<p>The League of Nations was an effort to
find for the nations of the world, a method
by which differences between nations would
automatically be brought before the court of
public opinion. Some kind of compromise
would be made and those involved would
feel that substantial justice had been done,
even though they might not at any one time
achieve all of their desires.</p>

<p>Many of us have become convinced that
the League of Nations as it stands today cannot
serve this purpose. The reason for this is
unimportant. The important thing now is
that we should concentrate on finding some
new machinery or revamping what already
exists so that every one will function within
it and have confidence in its honesty.</p>

<p>The people of the United States have
congratulated themselves on the fact that
they had made a beginning towards the development
of this machinery in their conferences<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
with the representatives of the other
American governments.</p>

<p>Perhaps we have a right to feel a sense of
satisfaction for as a nation we have made a
small beginning. We were cordially disliked
throughout South America for years because
we were the strongest nation on this continent.
We took the attitude of the big brother
for a long time and constituted ourselves the
defender of all the other nations. We were
not only the defender, however, we also considered
it our duty to set ourselves up as the
judge, and the only judge, of what should
happen in the internal as well as the external
affairs of our various neighbors.</p>

<p>To them it seemed a bullying, patronizing
attitude. As they grew stronger, they resented
it, but we went right on regardless of their
feelings. During the past few years we have
put ourselves imaginatively into their situation.
The final result is that we have reached
an amicable understanding and actually are
in a fair way to get together and discuss subjects
of mutual interest with little or no sense<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
of suspicion and fear being involved in the
discussion. This can, of course, be spoiled at
any time by the selfishness of individual citizens
who may decide that, as individuals,
they can exploit some other nation on the
North or South American continents. The
restraint of these individuals will not be a
question of government action, but of the
force of public opinion which, it is to be
hoped, will be able to control and exert a
potent influence because of the sense of responsibility
acquired by our citizens.</p>

<p>This is satisfactory, but there is still much
to be done before we can feel that even here
in the Americas we have a thoroughly sound
working basis for solving all misunderstandings.
We cannot be entirely satisfied with
anything, however, which does not include
the world as a whole, for we are all so closely
interdependent today that we can only operate
successfully when we all cooperate.</p>

<p>We have had the experience and can profit
by the mistakes and the difficulties through
which the League of Nations has passed.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
Every nation in the world still uses policemen
to control its unruly element. It may
be that any machinery set up today to deal
with international difficulties may require
policemen in order to function successfully,
but even a police force should not be called
upon until every other method of procedure
has been tried and proved unsuccessful.</p>

<p>We have some economic weapons which
can be used first and which may prove themselves
very efficient as the guardians of peace.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="max-width: 5em;">
  <img src="images/i_003.png" width="301" height="105" alt="decoration" /></div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">What</span> are our ultimate objectives and
how shall we achieve them? First,
the most important thing is that any difficulties
arising should automatically go before
some body which will publish the facts to the
world at large and give public opinion an
opportunity to make a decision. Then, a
group of world representatives will have to
decide with whom the fault lies. If their decision
is not accepted by the nations involved
and either nation attempts to use force in
coercing the other nation, or nations—in opposition
to what is clearly the majority opinion
of the world—then and then only, it
seems to me, the decision will be made that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
the nation using force is an aggressor nation.
Being an aggressor, the majority of nations
in opposition would be obliged to resort to
some method designed to make that nation
realize that they could not with impunity
flout the public opinion of the majority.</p>

<p>We need to define what an aggressor nation
is. We need to have a tribunal where the
facts in any case may be discussed, and the
decision made before the world, as to
whether a nation is an aggressor or not. Then
the steps decided upon could be taken in
conjunction with other nations.</p>

<p>First of all, trade should be withdrawn
from that nation and they should be barred
as traders in the countries disagreeing with
them. It would not seem probable that more
than this economic weapon would have to be
used but, if necessary in the end, the police
force could be called upon.</p>

<p>In the case of a clearly defined issue where
the majority of nations agreed, the police
force would simply try to prevent bloodshed
and aggression, and it would be in a very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
different position from an army which was
attempting to attack a country and subjugate
it. Even the use of a police force, which so
many think of as tantamount to war, would
really be very different and there would be
no idea of marching into a country or making
the people suffer or taking anything from
them. It would simply be a group of armed
men preventing either of the parties to a
quarrel from entering into a real war.</p>

<p>Of course, I can imagine cases in which
the police force might find itself in an unenviable
position, with two countries engaged
in a heated quarrel trying to do away
with the police so they could get at each
other!</p>

<p>All we can hope is that this situation will
not arise and that the non-aggressor party to
the quarrel, at least, may be willing to sit
peacefully by and see the police force repulse
the enemy without wishing to turn into aggressors
themselves.</p>

<p>With all our agitation about peace, we lose
sight of the fact that with the proper machinery<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
it is easier to keep out of situations
which lead to war than it is to bring about
peace once war is actually going on.</p>

<p>I doubt very much whether peace is coming
to us either through plans, even my own
as I have outlined it, or through any of the
theories or hopes we now hold. What I have
outlined is not real peace, just a method of
trying to deal with our difficulties a little
better than we have in the past, in the world
as it is today. We may, of course, be wiped off
the face of the earth before we do even this.
Our real ultimate objective must be a change
in human nature for I have, as I said, yet to
see a peace plan which is really practical and
which has been thought through in every detail.
Therefore, I am inclined to believe that
there is no perfect and complete program for
bringing about peace in the world at the
present moment.</p>

<p>I often wonder as I look around the world
whether any of us, even we women, really
want peace. Women should realize better
than any one else, that the spirit of peace has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
to begin in the relationship between two individuals.
They know that a child alone may
be unhappy because he is alone, but there
will be no quarreling until another child appears
on the scene, and then the fur will fly,
if each of them desires the same thing at the
same time.</p>

<p>Women have watched this for generations
and must know, if peace is going to come
about in the world, the way to start is by getting
a better understanding between individuals.
From this germ a better understanding
between groups of people will grow.</p>

<p>In spite of this knowledge, I am sure that
women themselves are among the worst offenders
when it comes to petty quarrels. Mrs.
J—— will refuse to speak to Mrs. C——
because Mrs. C——’s dog came through the
hedge and mussed up Mrs. J——’s flowerbed.
No one will deny that occurrences of
this kind are irritating in the extreme, but is
it worth a feud between two neighbors, perhaps
old friends or even acquaintances who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
must live next door to each other and see
each other almost every day?</p>

<p>At the moment we, as a nation, are looking
across the Atlantic and the Pacific, patting
ourselves on the back and saying how fortunate
we are to be away from all their excitements.
We feel a little self-righteous, and forget
that we ourselves have been engaged in a
war on the average of every forty years since
our nation was founded. We even fought a
civil war, complicated by the alignment of
other nations with one side or the other,
though no foreign soldiers actually came to
fight on either side.</p>

<p>The people who settled in New England
came here for religious freedom, but religious
freedom to them meant freedom only
for their kind of religion. They were not going
to be any more liberal to others who differed
with them in this new country, than
others had been with them in the countries
from which they came. This attitude seems
to be our attitude in many situations today.</p>

<p>Very few people in any nation today are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
inclined to be really liberal in allowing real
freedom to other individuals. Like our forebears
we want freedom for ourselves, but not
for those who differ from us. To think and
act as we please within the limits, of course,
caused by the necessity for respecting the
equal rights which must belong to our neighbors,
would seem to be almost a platitudinous
doctrine, yet we would frequently like
to overlook these limits and permit no freedom
to our neighbors. If this is our personal
attitude, it is not strange that our national
attitude is similar. We are chiefly concerned
with the rights and privileges of our own
people and we show little consideration for
the rights and privileges of others. In this we
are not very different from other nations
both in the past and in the present.</p>

<p>I can almost count on the fingers of one
hand the people whom I think are real pacifists.
By that I mean, the people who are
really making an effort in their personal lives
to bring about an atmosphere which will be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
conducive to a solution of all our difficulties
in a peaceful manner.</p>

<p>The first step towards achieving this end is
self-discipline and self-control. The second is
a certain amount of imagination which will
enable us to understand situations in which
other people find themselves. We may learn
to be less indignant at any slight or seeming
slight, and we may try to find some way by
which to remove the cause of the troubles
which arise between individuals, if we become
disciplined and cultivate our imaginative
faculties. Once we achieve a technique
by which we control our own emotions, we
certainly will be better able to teach young
people how to get on together. They may
then find some saner way of settling questions
under dispute than by merely punching
each other’s noses!</p>

<p>When we once control ourselves and submit
personal differences to constituted authorities
for settlement, we can say that we
have a will to peace between individuals.
Before we come to the question of what may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
be the technique between nations, however,
we must go a step farther and set our national
house in order. On every hand we see
today miniature wars going on between conflicting
interests. As the example most constantly
before us, take capital and labor. If
their difficulties are settled by arbitration
and no blood is shed, we can feel we have
made real strides towards approaching our
international problems. We are not prepared
to do this, however, when two factions in a
group having the same basic interests cannot
come to an agreement between themselves.
Their ability to obtain what they desire is
greatly weakened until they can reach an
understanding and work as a unit. The basis
of this understanding should not be hard to
reach if the different personalities involved
could forget themselves as individuals and
think only of the objectives in view, and of
the best way to obtain them.</p>

<p>Granted that they are able to do this, then
we can approach our second problem with
the knowledge that more deeply conflicting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
interests are at stake but that those with common
interests can state their case so the public
may form their opinion. Here again, if
you could take it for granted that on both
sides a real desire existed amongst those representing
divergent interests to consider unselfishly
ultimate goals and benefits for the
majority, rather than any individual gain or
loss, it would undoubtedly be possible to
reach a peaceful agreement.</p>

<p>Human beings, however, do not stride
from peak to peak, they climb laboriously up
the side of the mountain. The public will
have to understand each case as it comes up
and force divergent interests to find a solution.
The real mountain climber never gives
up until he has reached the highest peak and
the lure of the climb to this peak is always
before him to draw him on.</p>

<p>That should be the way in human progress—a
peaceful, quiet progress. We cannot follow
this way, however, until human nature
becomes less interested in self, acquires some
of the vision and persistence of the mountain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
climber, and realizes that physical forces
must be harnessed and controlled by disciplined
mental and spiritual forces.</p>

<p>When we have achieved a nation where
the majority of the people is of this type,
then we can hope for some measure of success
in changing our procedure when international
difficulties arise.</p>

<p>What we have said really means that we
believe in one actual way to peace—making
a fundamental change in human nature.
Over and over again people will tell you that
that is impossible. I cannot see why it should
be impossible when the record of history
shows so many changes already gone through.</p>

<p>Only the other day I heard it stated that
there are only two real divisions which can
be made between people—the people who
have good intentions, and the people who
have evil intentions. The same man who
made this distinction between people, made
the suggestion that eventually there should
be in the government, a department where
business—the business that wishes to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
fair and square—could lay its plans before
a chosen group of men representing business,
the public and the government. They could
ask for advice as to whether the plans proposed
were according to the best business interests
of the country and the majority of the
people and receive in return a disinterested,
honest opinion. Immediately the remonstrance
was made that this would be impossible
because it would be difficult for an
advisory group to know if the plans laid
before them were honestly stated, and people
of evil intentions could use such a group to
promote plans for selfish interests rather than
for the general welfare. This is undoubtedly
true, and we are up against exactly the same
situation in trying to obtain peace between
groups within nations as we are on the international
fronts.</p>

<p>Human beings either must recognize the
fact that what serves the people as a whole
serves them best as individuals and, through
selfish or unselfish interests, they become people
of good intentions and honesty. If not we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
will be unable to move forward except as
we have moved in the past with recourse to
force, and constant, suspicious watchfulness
on the part of individuals and groups towards
each other. The preservation of our
civilization seems to demand a permanent
change of attitude and therefore every effort
should be bent towards bringing about this
change in human nature through education.
This is a slow way and, in the meantime, we
need not sit with folded hands and feel that
no steps can be taken to ward off the dangers
which constantly beset us.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">We</span> can begin, and begin at once, to set
up some machinery. Our international
difficulties will then automatically be
taken up before they reach the danger point.
One of our great troubles is that it is nobody’s
business to try to straighten out difficulties
between nations in the early stages. If
they are allowed to continue too long, they
grow more and more bitter and little things,
which might at first have been easily explained
or settled, take on the proportions of
a bitter and important quarrel.</p>

<p>We do not scrap our whole judicial machinery
just because we are not sure that the
people who appear before the bar are telling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
the truth. We go ahead and do our best to
ascertain the truth in any given case, and
substantial justice seems to be done in a majority
of situations. This same thing would
have to satisfy us for a time at least in the
results achieved by whatever machinery we
set up to solve our international difficulties.</p>

<p>I am not advocating any particular machinery.
The need seems fairly obvious. To
say that we cannot find a way is tantamount
to acknowledging that we are going to watch
our civilization wipe itself off the face of the
earth.</p>

<p>For those of us who remember the World
War, there is little need to paint a picture of
war conditions, but the generation that participated
in that war is growing older. To the
younger group what they have not seen and
experienced themselves actually means little.</p>

<p>I heard a gentleman who loves adventure
say the other day that he could recruit an
army of young people at any time to go to
war in any part of the world. They would
believe that the danger was slight, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
fun and comradeship and adventure would
be attractive. I protested violently that youth
today was not so gullible, but down in the
bottom of my heart I am a little apprehensive.
Therefore, it seems to me that one of
our first duties is constantly to paint for
young people a realistic picture of war. You
cannot gainsay the assertion that war brings
out certain fine qualities in human nature.
People will make sacrifices which they would
not make in the ordinary course of existence.
War will give opportunities for heroism
which do not arise in every-day living, but
this is not all that war will do.</p>

<p>It will place men for weeks under conditions
which are physically so bad that years
later they may still be suffering from the
effects of this “period of adventure” even
though they may not have been injured by
shot or shell during this time of service.
Upon many people it will have mental or
psychological effects which will take them
years to overcome. In many countries of the
world there are people to attest to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
changed human beings who have returned
to them after the World War. Men who
could no longer settle down to their old
work, men who had seen such horrors that
they could no longer sleep quietly at night,
men who do not wish to speak of their experiences.
It is a rather exceptional person
who goes through a war and comes out unscathed
physically, mentally or morally.</p>

<p>Secondly, it is one’s duty to youth to point
out that there are ways of living heroically
during peace times. I do not imagine that
Monsieur and Madame Curie ever felt the
lack of adventure in their lives, for there is
nothing more adventurous than experimentation
with an unknown element. Their purpose
was to find something of benefit to the
human race. They jeopardized no lives but
their own.</p>

<p>I doubt if Father Damien ever felt that his
life lacked adventure; and I can think of a
hundred places in our own country today
where men or women might lead their lives
unknown or unsung beyond the borders of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
their own communities and yet never lack
for adventure and interest. Those who set
themselves the task of making their communities
into places in which the average
human being may obtain a share, not only
of greater physical well-being, but of wider
mental and spiritual existence, will lead an
active and adventurous life to reach their
goal.</p>

<p>This will need energy, patience and understanding
beyond the average, qualities of
leadership to win other men to their point of
view, unselfishness and heroism, for they may
be asked to make great sacrifices. To reach
their objectives they may have to hand over
their leadership to other men, their characters
may be maligned, their motives impugned,
but they must remain completely
indifferent if only in the end they achieve
their objectives. Moral courage of a rare kind
will be required of them.</p>

<p>In the wars of the past, deeds of valor and
heroism have won decorations from governments
and the applause of comrades in arms,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
but the men who lead in civic campaigns
may hope for none of these recognitions. The
best that can happen to them is that they may
live to see a part of their dreams come true,
they may keep a few friends who believe in
them and their own consciences may bring
them inner satisfactions.</p>

<p>Making our every-day living an adventure
is probably our best safeguard against war.
But there are other steps which we might
well take.</p>

<p>Let us examine again, for example, the
ever-recurring question of the need for armaments
as a means of defense and protection
and see if something cannot be done immediately.
Many people feel the building of
great military machines lead us directly into
war for when you acquire something it is
always a temptation to use it.</p>

<p>It is perfectly obvious, however, that no
nation can cut down its army and navy and
armaments in general when the rest of the
world is not doing the same thing.</p>

<p>We ourselves have a long unfortified border<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
on the north which has remained undefended
for more than a hundred years, a
shining example of what peace and understanding
between two nations can accomplish.
But we also have two long coast lines
to defend and the Panama Canal, which in
case of war must be kept open, therefore it
behooves us to have adequate naval defense.
Just what we mean by adequate defense is a
point on which a great many people differ.</p>

<p>Innumerable civilians have ideas as to
what constitutes adequate military preparedness
and the people most concerned, our
military forces, have even more definite
ideas. Many people in the United States feel
that we are still rendered practically safe by
the expanse of water on our east and west
coasts. Some people even feel, like Mr. William
Jennings Bryan, that if our nation
needed to be defended a million men would
spring to arms over night. They forget that
a million untrained, unarmed men would be
a poor defense. We must concede that our
military establishments have probably made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
a more careful, practical study of the situation
than any one else, for they know they
would have to be ready for action at once.</p>

<p>Whether we accept the civil or the military
point of view on preparedness, we can
still move forward. We can continue to try
to come to an understanding with other nations
on some of the points which lead to bad
feeling. We can begin first, perhaps, with the
Central and South American nations and
continue later with other nations, to enter
into agreements which may lead to the
gradual reduction of armaments. If we only
agree on one thing at a time, every little step
is something to the good. Simply because we
have so far not been able to arrive at any
agreement is no reason for giving up the
attempt to agree. No one has as yet discovered
a way to make any of the methods of
transportation by which we all travel around
the world, absolutely safe, but nobody suggests
that we should do away with ships and
railroads and airplanes. I feel that the people
of various nations can greatly influence their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
governments and representatives and encourage
action along the lines of reduction
in arms and munitions.</p>

<p>Every international group that meets must
bear in mind that they have an opportunity
to create better feeling, but to move forward
along this particular front also requires the
backing of public opinion at home. This
opinion may be formed in many little groups
all over the world and may be felt in an ever
widening circle of nations until it becomes a
formidable force in the world as a whole.</p>

<p>Then there is the matter of private interests
involved in the manufacture of arms and
munitions. I know there are many arguments
advanced against government ownership of
the factories making arms and munitions.
When you know the story of the part played
by certain families in Europe whose business
it has been to manufacture arms and munitions,
however, you wonder if the arguments
advanced against this step are not inspired in
large part by those whose interests lie in this
particular business?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span></p>

<p>It is true that a government can lose its
perspective for a number of reasons. The
need for employment may push them to over-production,
as well as fear of their neighbors,
and they may manufacture so much that the
temptation to use it may be great. Some governments
today manufacture practically all
they need for peace-time purposes and this is
a safeguard, but for war-time use, all governments
would have to fall back on private
manufacturers who could convert their
plants easily for the manufacturing of war
materials. Some governments today encourage
private manufacturers to produce arms
and munitions needed in peace time by buying
from them, but the great danger lies in
the uncontrolled private production which
is used for export. The element of private
profit is a great incentive towards the increase
of this business just as it is in any other
business. Governments are not tempted in
the same way, for they do not manufacture
for export or for profit.</p>

<p>It seems to me that we must trust some one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
and I think perhaps it is wiser to trust a
government than the more vulnerable and
easily tempted individual. Besides which, a
democracy has it within its power to control
any government business and, therefore, the
idea that our government should control the
manufacture of arms and munitions fills me
with no great trepidation.</p>

<p>This control of the manufacture of arms
and munitions is a measure which could be
undertaken by one government alone. It does
not have to wait for all the other governments
to concur, and so I believe either in
complete government ownership or in the
strictest kind of government supervision,
allowing such manufacture as will supply our
own country but which will not create a surplus
for exportation, thus removing the incentive
for constantly seeking and creating
new markets.</p>

<p>The next step will be the mutual curtailment,
very gradually I am sure, of the
amount of armaments the world over. This
is a difficult step, because it requires not only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
an agreement on the part of all the nations,
but sufficient confidence in each other to believe
that, having given their word, they will
live up to the spirit of the agreement as well
as to the letter of it, and not try cleverly to
hide whatever they have done from possible
inspectors.</p>

<p>They will not, for instance, destroy a battleship
and add a half dozen airplanes, telling
the other members to the agreement that
they have carried out the promised reduction,
but forgetting to mention the additions
to some other arm of their military service.</p>

<p>This lack of integrity, or perhaps we
should call it more politely the desire to be
a little more clever than one’s neighbor, is
what promotes a constant attitude of suspicion
amongst nations. This will exist until
we have accomplished a change in human
nature and that is why for the present it
seems to me necessary to have inspection and
policing as well as an agreement.</p>

<p>The objection will be made that in the nations
which are not democracies a government<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
might build up a great secret arsenal;
but in those countries this could be done today
for most of them control the press and all
out-going information with an iron hand.</p>

<p>Outside of the democracies, government
ownership is a much more serious danger on
this account. If all nations were obliged to
report their military strength to some central
body, and this body was allowed to inspect
and vouch for the truth of their statements,
then all governments could feel secure
against that hidden danger which is now part
of the incentive for a constant increase in the
defense machinery of every nation.</p>

<p>Here again we are confronted with the
need of some machinery to work for peace.
I have already stated that I doubt if the present
League of Nations could ever be made to
serve the purpose for which it was originally
intended. This does not mean that I do not
believe that we could get together. We might
even begin by setting up regional groups in
different parts of the world which might
eventually amalgamate into a central body.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
It seems to me almost a necessity that we
have some central body as a means of settling
our difficulties, with an international police
force to enforce its decisions, as long as we
have not yet reached the point everywhere
of setting force aside.</p>

<p>Joint economic action on the part of a
group of nations will undoubtedly be very
effective, but it will take time to educate
people to a point where they are willing to
sacrifice, even temporarily, material gains in
the interests of peace, so I doubt whether we
can count at once on complete cooperation
in the use of an economic boycott. To be a
real weapon against any nation wishing to
carry on war, it must be well carried out by
a great number of nations.</p>

<p>Another small and perhaps seemingly unimportant
thing might be done immediately.
It might be understood that in war time
every one should become a part of the military
service and no one should be allowed to
make any profit either in increased wages or
in increased interest on their capital investment.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
This might bring about a little more
universal interest in peace, and more active
interest in the efforts to prevent war whether
a man were going to the front or staying at
home.</p>

<p>Of course, when we talk of “the front” in
connection with future wars, we are taking
it for granted that future wars will be much
like those of the past, whereas most people
believe that future wars will have no fronts.
What we hear of Spain and China makes this
seem very probable. Gases and airplanes will
not be directed only against armed forces, or
military centers, they may be used for the
breaking of morale in the opposing nation.
That will mean shelling of unfortified cities,
towns and villages, and the killing of women
and children. In fact this means the participation
in war of entire populations.</p>

<p>One other element must be considered,
namely, the creating of public opinion today.
Wars have frequently been declared in the
past with the backing of the nations involved
because public opinion had been influenced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
through the press and through other mediums,
either by the governments themselves
or by certain powerful interests which desired
war. Could that be done again today in
our own country or have we become suspicious
of the written word and the inspired
message? I think that as a people we look for
motives more carefully than we did in the
past but whether issues could be clouded for
us is one of the questions that no one can
answer until the test comes.</p>

<p>I am inclined to think that if a question as
serious as going to war were presented to our
nation we would demand facts unvarnished
by interpretation. Whether we even in our
free democracy could obtain them is another
question. Who controls the dissemination of
news? Is the press totally, uncompromisingly
devoted to the unbiased presentation of all
news insofar as possible? Is it possible for
groups with special interests to put pressure
on the press and on our other means of disseminating
information, such as the radio
and the screen, and to what extent?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span></p>

<p>This is an interesting study in every country
where people are really interested in good
will and peace. If these sources of information
are not really free should not the people
insist that this be one of our first reforms?
Without it we can have no sound basis on
which to form our opinions.</p>

<p>These are things we can work for immediately,
but some of my friends consider
that one point transcends all others and epitomizes
the way to “peace.”</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">We</span> can establish no real trust between
nations until we acknowledge the
power of love above all other power. We cannot
cast out fear and therefore we cannot
build up trust. Perfectly obvious and perfectly
true, but we are back again to our
fundamental difficulty—the education of the
individual human being, and that takes time.
We cannot sit around a table and discuss
our difficulties until we are able to state them
frankly. We must feel that those who listen
wish to get at the truth and desire to do what
is best for all. We must reach a point where
we can recognize the rights and needs of
others, as well as our own rights and needs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span></p>

<p>I have a group of religious friends who
claim that the answer to all these difficulties
is a great religious revival. They may be
right, but great religious revivals which are
not simply short emotional upheavals lifting
people to the heights and dropping them
down again below the place from which they
rose, mean a fundamental change in human
nature. That change will come to some people
through religion, but it will not come to
all that way, for I have known many people,
very fine people, who had no formal religion.
So the change must come to some, perhaps,
through a new code of ethics, or an awakening
sense of responsibility for their brothers,
or a discovery that whether they believe in a
future life or not, there are now greater enjoyments
and rewards in this world than
those which they have envisioned in the past.</p>

<p>I would have people begin at home to discover
for themselves the meaning of brotherly
love. A friend of mine wrote me the
other day that she wondered what would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
happen if occasionally a member of Congress
got up and mentioned in the House the
existence of brotherly love. You laugh, it
seems fantastic, but this subject will, I am
sure, have to be discussed throughout the
world for many years before it becomes an
accepted rule. We will have to want peace,
want it enough to pay for it, pay for it in our
own behavior and in material ways. We will
have to want it enough to overcome our lethargy
and go out and find all those in other
countries who want it as much as we do.</p>

<p>Some time we must begin, for where there
is no beginning there is no end, and if we
hope to see the preservation of our civilization,
if we believe that there is anything
worthy of perpetuation in what we have
built thus far, then our people must turn to
brotherly love, not as a doctrine but as a way
of living. If this becomes our accepted way
of life, this life may be so well worth living
that we will look into the future with a desire
to perpetuate a peaceful world for our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
children. With this desire will come a realization
that only if others feel as we do, can we
obtain the objectives of peace on earth, good
will to men.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If

without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
